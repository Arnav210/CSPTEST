    <h3>My Journey through the Tools Setup</h3>

    <p>
        While we were setting up the tools, at the beginning, I was really confused. I had no idea what we were doing and where to run the commands. However, as time went on and I asked for help, it became more clear to me. When we were making the nighthawk page, same thing. I was completely clueless at first but then I started to understand what different files did and how to make the code my own.

    <h3>Planning and Solutions</h3>

    <p>
        In order to meet the requirements and advance the variety of my page, I added images to the home site. However, the images would not show up when I was accessing them through a file. After some trial and error, I eventually figured out (with some help) that using the image adress of a google image would allow it to show up on the page. However, the image addresses are unbearably long, but I had to live with that cluttering up my home page. I had also planned to write things with Javascript or make a button that works through Javascript, but neither of those have worked for me. I will either continue to attempt the writing or figure out a new idea and get information on how to implement it.
